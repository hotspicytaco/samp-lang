# samp-lang

## Installation

- Move the .asi plugin to your SA directory;

- Create a folder named "samp-lang", then download one of the available translations from [here](https://github.com/BrunoBM16/samp-lang/releases/tag/Translations) (or make one yourself) and move it there;

- Open samp-lang.ini (which is created automatically after executing SA-MP with the plugin once, or simply download/create the file yourself), then write the language file name inside it (without the extension). If the language file doesn't exist, the strings won't be changed and the client will remain in English language.

## How to create a language file?

Simply download the template file and translate it, saving it with .ini extension.

## Requirements

ASI loader.
